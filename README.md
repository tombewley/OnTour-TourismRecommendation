# 	On Tour: Code for Recommender Models
In this MSc thesis project, I introduce a variety of data-driven models for recommending both city destinations and within-city points of interest to tourists. The models are implemented with a novel dataset of travel histories, derived from social media data, which is larger by size and scope than in prior work. All proposed models outperform simple baselines in cross-validation experiments, with the strongest variants reliably including touristsâ€™ true movements among their top recommendations. 

## This Repository
This repository has two folders:

- **code**: All code required to recreate the travel histories dataset from YFCC100M and OpenStreetMap, and deploy my recommender models on them. 

- **dataset**: The travel histories dataset itself, in `JSON` format.
